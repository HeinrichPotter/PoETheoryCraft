Notes:

Need to know before implementing beastcrafting:
> Remove catalyst quality?
> Ignore ilvl?  Always, or only when no valid mods under ilvl?  Is that a bug and might be fixed?
> Interaction with metamod locks?
> Interaction with fractured mods?

Do Conquerors' Exalts remove catalyst quality?

Catalysts may not cover every mod they're supposed to.  Can't find a list of tags each one works on so it's educated guesswork.
For instance, Fertile Catalysts not only apply to the new "catalyst_resource" tag, but also the "life" and "mana" tags that fossils use.

Need to figure out a good way to calculate mod tier, don't see a relevant stat in the json.
Rather not have to build a massive mod ID and item class table to look it up.

ModLogic saves time by assuming that adding an explicit mod will never increase an item's pool of rollable explicit mods.
I'm pretty sure this is true.  Simulation needs to be adjusted if not.

Are there any non-influenced mods with the same name as influences ("of the Hunt", etc)?
If not, ModLogic.GetInfluence can be simplified to check name instead of iterating through spawn_weight tags.
It would also allow easy grouping of ModsView by influence.

Need to test what happens when you exalt/regal/aug an item with no valid mods (due to ilvl and/or metamods).
Currently the simulation just does nothing.

Translation currently ignores digits of precision 0dp/1dp/2dp, just displays up to two decimals if they're nonzero.

Can't bench mod Fishing Rods? Bench mod definitions don't include their class but I haven't tested in-game.

Rune Dagger and Warstaff item classes aren't included in essence definitions, but essences work on them in-game anyway.
Currently they're explicitly checked as Dagger and Staff in CraftingBench.ApplyEssence.

Funfact: some old nerfs were implemented (on the client side) by adding a handler to the text localization process.
Example: Voltaxic's conversion mod is still 100% in definition, but has a "60% of Value" handler tacked on.

A mod tag for fossils is "defences" - plural with a 'c', while another tag for catalysts is "jewellery_defense" - singular with an 's'.

PoEDB inconsistency?: dodge mods on armor have the "defences" tag and should be blocked by pristine fossil.

Odd tag behavior on boots: Redeemer's attack dodge blocks Elder's spell dodge, but is not blocked BY it. Also doesn't block Redeemer's spell dodge.
All attack dodge mods add a "spell_dodge_tag" to item, but only Elder's spell dodge boot mods ever check against it.

ItemCraft.CalcProperties will need adjusting if items with properties can ever get catalyst quality (currently not the case).
Currently it scans mods, then uses results to update properties and quality, but changing catalyst quality can affect mods that affect properties.
