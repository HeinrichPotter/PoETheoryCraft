v0.3.0 Changelog:

Function:
Can now graph the distribution of any mod stat, item property, or weighted total that you specify.
Added most pseudo-stats from the official trade site to filter options.

Simulation:
Significantly improved mass-sim speed when different mod groups rarely interact.  That's most cases aside from weapons and jewels.
Added option to fill prefixes/suffixes, for simulating metacrafting or alt-aug rolling.
Enabled manually locking affixes, for scuffed Awakener's Orb sim or for fractured mods.  Manual locks DO apply to fossils and essences, unlike metamods.

UI:
Color-coded influenced mods and fossil mods in mod view.
Added progress bar popup while processing large batches (default >20k items, adjustable in .config).
Added .config option for mod view to expand all mod groups by default.


v0.2.0 Changelog:

Simulation:
Positive fossil modifiers now stack additively, to be consistent with test results.
Corrupted Essence mods from Glyphic/Tangled now obey weight modifiers from other fossils.
Added missing crafted mod restrictions based on spawn weight (such as Int+Quality craft being blocked by delve Quality mod).
Tentatively added 1% mod weight per 1% matching catalyst quality.

UI:
Mod preview now shows each weight as a percent of total rollable affix weight.
Made mod preview ignore existing mods on item when reroll currencies are selected (chaos, alch, alt, trans, essences, fossils).

Misc:
Fixed problem exporting items to PoB due to bad rare item name formatting.



Notes:

Maybe save post-craft options per item class in a dictionary?

Need to know before implementing beastcrafting:
> Remove catalyst quality?
> Ignore ilvl?  Uses beast's level?  Always, or only when no valid mods under ilvl?  Is that a bug and might be fixed?
> Interaction with metamod locks?
> Interaction with fractured mods?

Do Conquerors' Exalts remove catalyst quality?

Need to figure out a good way to calculate mod tier, don't see a relevant stat in the json.
Rather not have to build a massive mod ID and item class table to look it up.

Dark theme?  Item display is black anyway, and currency box is black because the transparent icons look awful on white.

Fossil Helm mods have extra -X% resistance stats attached (same in PoEDB), programmatically indistinguishable from normal resist stats.
Could manually remove the lines from those specific mod templates if there's no good reason to keep them.

ModLogic saves time by assuming that adding an explicit mod will never increase an item's pool of rollable explicit mods.
I'm pretty sure this is true.  Simulation needs to be adjusted if not.

Are there any non-influenced mods with the same name as influences ("of the Hunt", etc)?
If not, ModLogic.GetInfluence can be simplified to check name instead of iterating through spawn_weight tags.
It would also allow easy grouping of ModsView by influence.

Translation currently ignores digits of precision 0dp/1dp/2dp, just displays up to two decimals if they're nonzero.

Can't bench mod Fishing Rods? Bench mod definitions don't include their class but I haven't tested in-game.

ItemParser.ParseProperties will need adjusting if items with properties can ever get catalyst quality (currently not the case).
Currently catalyst quality is only factored in at translation, so mods give their non-qualitied value while calculating properties.
