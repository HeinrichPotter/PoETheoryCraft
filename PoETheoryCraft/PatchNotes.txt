v0.3.0 - Graphs and Performance improvements

> You can now graph the distribution of any mod stat, item property, or weighted total that you specify.
> Added most searchable pseudo-stats and item properties from the official trade site to filter options.

Simulation:
> Significantly improved simulation speed when different mod groups rarely interact (that's most crafts aside from weapons and jewels).
> Added option to fill prefixes/suffixes, for simulating metacrafting or alt-aug rolling.
> Enabled manually locking affixes, for scuffed Awakener's Orb sim or for fractured mods.

UI:
> Color-coded influenced mods and fossil mods in mod view.
> Added progress bar popup while processing large batches (default >20k items, adjustable in .config).
> Added .config option for mod view to expand all mod groups by default.



v0.2.0 - Search/Filter Enabled -

> You can now search through your mass crafting results just like on a trade site.
      Example: https://imgur.com/a/qqjlVE8
> There are only a few pseudo stats pre-defined for searching at the moment.
      You can define your own in user_pseudo_stats.json, following the format of the examples.
      They're basically custom weighted searches that you can save for repeated use.

Simulation:
> Positive fossil modifiers now stack additively, to be consistent with test results.
> Corrupted Essence mods from Glyphic/Tangled now obey weight modifiers from other fossils.
> Prevented crafting +quality mods on an item that already has a +quality mod.
> Tentatively added 1% mod weight per 1% matching catalyst quality for all currencies.
      All I got from testing with 200 rolls is that the effect is very little, if any at all.
      It could be that catalyst quality only affects currencies that remove quality - that'll be the next thing to test.
      You can turn the bonus off or change it to anything in App.config

UI:
> Mod preview now shows each weight as a percent of total rollable affix weight.
> Made mod preview ignore existing mods on item when reroll currencies are selected (chaos, alch, alt, trans, essences, fossils).

Misc:
> Fixed problem exporting items to PoB due to bad rare item name formatting.  Right-click anywhere on an item or the mass-craft area for the option to copy one or all items to clipboard.



v0.1.0
- Initial Features -

Mechanics:
> All craftable gear and jewel bases.
> All relevant currencies and essences; all relevant fossils except Sanctified Fossil.
> Tentative Catalyst support - will change mod values, but no effect on roll weights (needs much more testing).

Functions:
> Mod View - Shows all mods that can be rolled on a given item and their weights; can force-add any mod to item.
> Crafted Mod View - Shows all bench crafts that can be applied and their costs.
> Mass Craft - Apply selected currency to an item any number of times (in parallel) and show results.
      Click on any stat line or item property to sort all results by that condition.
      Copy one item, one page, or all results to clipboard via right-click context menu.
> Post-roll Actions - Automatically apply specified bench mods, or maximize mod rolls (as if divining) for better comparison.
> Currency tracker - Tallies currency spent (except when mass crafting), can be reset whenever.


- In Progress (coming soon) -

> Stash page; moving items between bench, mass craft results, and stash.
> Trade-site-esque search/filter functions for mass craft results.
> Ability to lock mods on an item while rolling.
      Not like metamod locks, can't be ignored by essences/fossils.
      Useful for simulating Awakener's Orb (force add, lock two influenced mods, then roll w/ chaos).
      Also kinda usable for fractured mods, but the simulator is unlikely to ever support legacy rolls not in current game data.



Dev Notes:

Need to know before implementing beastcrafting:
> Remove catalyst quality?
> Ignore ilvl?  Uses beast's level?  Always, or only when no valid mods under ilvl?  Is that a bug and might be fixed?
> Interaction with metamod locks?
> Interaction with fractured mods?

Do Conquerors' Exalts remove catalyst quality?

Need to figure out a good way to calculate mod tier, don't see a relevant stat in the json.
Rather not have to build a massive mod ID and item class table to look it up.

ModLogic saves time by assuming that adding an explicit mod will never increase an item's pool of rollable explicit mods.
I'm pretty sure this is true.  Simulation needs to be adjusted if not.

Translation currently ignores digits of precision 0dp/1dp/2dp, just displays up to two decimals if they're nonzero.

Can't bench mod Fishing Rods? Bench mod definitions don't include their class but I haven't tested in-game.

ItemParser.ParseProperties will need adjusting if items with properties can ever get catalyst quality (currently not the case).
Currently catalyst quality is only factored in at translation, so mods give their non-qualitied value while calculating properties.
